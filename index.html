                <p>Bill Clark is an Academy Award-winning pharologist, 
                who has studied under firefighting grandmasters in Tibet in the arts of rescuing cats 
                from trees and turning the world on with his smile. He is the author of less than eighty 
                New York Times best-selling books (mostly about how to give him money for more books) 
                and holds two Mensa memberships. This is definitely because their current grading scale 
                is too low and not because he put on a fake mustache and got back in line a second 
                time.</p>

                <p>I also heard that they awarded him “Man of the Year”. Twice. In the same year. I mean, 
                they didn’t, but you could imagine what it would be like if they did, right? Yeah, you could. 
                That guy sounds awesome.</p>

                <p>His mom definitely thinks so. Mr. Clark is also a Business Office Manager for a fast-paced 
                janitorial and maintenance company with 18+ years of management experience. He graduated from 
                Florida State University with two BAs, in Pre-Med Biological Science and in Business 
                Administration.</p>

                <p>He lives in relative seclusion in Longwood, Florida with his amazing wife and son, 
                where he hopes to pursue a career in web development or to finish writing his rock opera about 
                quilting, whichever comes first.</p>
